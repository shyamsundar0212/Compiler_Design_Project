# C++ syntax errors checking using python
## Motive Of the project
 Developing a parser in Python language that accepts code in C++ and checks for syntax errors (Expected: boolean, char, string)
## Basic Components required for problem given :
**Lexer :** Takes the input test c++ files and produces list of tokens, stored in list name "tokens".<br/>
**Parser :** Takes the stream of tokens as input and produces parse tree and checks for syntactical errors present in stream.
## Steps to run :
- Clone the Repo/ Download the Zip file.<br/>
- Unzip the folder in Compatable platforms like VScode.<br/>
- Type the C++ code in the testcase file 
- In the "lexer.py" enter the path of the test case file that has to be used in the first cell.</br>
- Then run all cells of the "lexer.ipynb" and "parser.ipynb" respectively.</br>
- The errors and output will be printed in the end cell of "parser.ipynb".</br>
